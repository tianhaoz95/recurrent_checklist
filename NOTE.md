Create a flutter application to automate recurrent checklists. The goal is to automate the process of recurrent routines. The user can create events where each event is associated with a checklist. When the user choose to add a event, all the items in the checklist of this event will be added to a pool of checklist items, and the user can then check the items in the pool to get tasks done. The UI of the application consists of a sign in screen, a sign up screen, a checklist screen, a events screen, a settings screen. When the user first open the app, the user will be presented with the sign in screen, and by tapping on a sign up button on the sign in screen, the user can navigate to the sign up screen. Once the user successfully sign in, the user will be naviated to the main screen, which is a combination of checklist screen, events screen, and settings screen with a bottom navigator to navigate between them. The bottom navigator will have icons and text, for checklist screen, it will have a check mark icon and text "checklist", for event screen, it will have a list icon and text "events", for settings screen, it will have a setting icon and text "settings". The checklist screen should have a list of items. Each item is a row with checkbox on the left and text content of the item on the right. On the top of the checklist screen, there should be a icon button to sort the list and another button to delete all checked items. The event screen should have a list of events, each row should have 3 sub-rows, the first row is the event name and note, second row shows all the checlist items associated with it, and 3rd row are buttons for editing the event, deleting the event, and add new items to the event checklist. The events screen should have a floating button with "add" icon for adding new events. When the user taps on the add button, a pop up should show up to let user create a new event with name and note, and checklist items should not be added here but later by tapping on the add checklist button on the event row. To add Firebase into the Flutter project, prompt the user to run `flutterfire configure --project=recurrent-checklist` and wait for user to report back.

Add feature to add all items from a event into checklist pool. Add a button with text "add" to each event. When the user tap on the button, all items from the event will be added to the checklist pool.

Fix: tapping on the add button on checlist screen does not bring up the pop up to add an item.

Fix error when the user tap on the add checklist button in the events screen. It failed to add all items from the event to the checklist pool, and it error out with "no items to add from this event" when there are items.
